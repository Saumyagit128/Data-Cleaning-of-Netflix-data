## ‚úÖ Data Cleaning Tasks Performed

- **Missing Value Handling**
  - Filled missing `director`, `cast`, and `country` values with `"Unknown"`.
  - The missing values in rating was imputed with its mode, since this attribute was discrete.
  - Records with missing values in the date_added column were dropped, since they were significantly low (10)

- **Duplicate Removal**
  - There were no duplicates in the dataframe.

- **Changing Datatype**

  - **Duration**
    - Typecasting of 'duration' from string to integer
    - For Tv shows, the duration represents 'number of seasons'
    - For movies, the duration represents 'movie length in minutes'
 
  - **Date Parsing**
    - Converted `date_added` to datetime format.
    - Extracted `year_added` and `month_added` from `date_added`.
    
- **Whitespace Removal**
  - Removed leading and trailing whitespaces from all string columns.

- **Column Name Standardization**
  - Renamed all column headers to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores.

- **Data Export**
  - Exported cleaned dataset to a CSV file for downstream use.
